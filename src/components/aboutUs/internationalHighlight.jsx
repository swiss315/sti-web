                        Our continued success over the years saw the company’s performance ranked among the top players
                        in the insurance industry in the country. From 2007 up to year 2021, the South African-based
                        Rating organization, Global Credit Rating, (GCR), had consistently rated the Company A- in
                        attestation of the Company’s high claims-paying ability in the insurance industry. The
                        considerations for the rating amongst others were based on the company’s sizable capital base,
                        sound internal capital generation, healthy investment returns, foreign exchange gains, and a
                        strong liquidity profile backed by a conservative assets allocation strategy.

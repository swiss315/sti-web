                        Distinguished Shareholders, fellow Board members, representatives of the various
                        regulatory bodies here present, members of the Press, ladies and gentlemen, it
                        is my
                        pleasure to welcome you all, on behalf of the Board of Directors, to the 29th
                        Annual
                        General Meeting of our company, Sovereign Trust Insurance Plc and to present the
                        Annual
                        Report and Accounts for the period ended December 31, 2023 for your
                        consideration.
                        The socio-political and economic events that characterized business operations
                        in 2023
                        cannot be easily forgotten with its attendant implications on sustainability and
                        profitability of businesses both at the global and national stage.
                        Our resolve to remain financially viable and profitable as a business entity has
                        been
                        the driving force behind the resilience we brought to bear in the year under
                        review.
                        Permit me to conduct a brief review of the global and domestic environment which
                        shaped
                        our operations in year 2023.

                    <p className="text-xs lg:text-sm xl:text-sm ">
                        The Russian-Ukraine war which broke out on February 24, 2022, still continued in
                        the
                        wake of 2023 without any clear sign that the war will end anytime soon despite
                        entreaties from well-meaning world leaders and concerned parties calling for
                        ceasefire
                        from both warring nations. In the same breath, the Israel-Hamas war which began
                        in
                        October 2023, in the Gaza Strip still pose a threat to world peace and
                        stability.
                        The year also recorded significant number of natural disasters as a result of
                        severe
                        climate change in the world. 2023 witnessed unprecedented global temperatures
                        and
                        extreme weather events, underscoring the urgent need for collective action to
                        address
                        the climate crisis. Despite growing awareness and international agreements,
                        efforts
                        to
                        mitigate climate change remain insufficient, risking catastrophic consequences
                        for
                        ecosystems and human societies worldwide. Urgent measures to reduce greenhouse
                        gas
                        emissions and adapt to changing climatic conditions are essential to
                        safeguarding
                        the
                        planet’s future.
                        Tensions between the United States and China escalated in 2023, driven by
                        geopolitical
                        rivalries and strategic competition. Despite efforts to ease tensions through
                        diplomatic
                        channels, incidents such as the Chinese surveillance ballon crossing into United
                        States
                        airspace heightened mistrust and exacerbated bilateral frictions. The lack of
                        effective
                        communication channels between the two superpowers underscores the challenges of
                        managing complex security dynamics in the Indo-Pacific region.
                        On the business angle, the rapid advancement of artificial intelligence (AI)
                        presents
                        both promise and peril for society. While AI innovations hold the potential to
                        revolutionize various industries and address complex challenges, concerns about
                        ethical
                        implications and societal disruptions have intensified. The need for responsible
                        AI
                        governance and proactive measures to address potential risks remains critical in
                        navigating the evolving landscape of AI technology.
                        In a historic shift, India has surpassed China as the world’s most populous
                        country,
                        with an estimated population of 1.43 billion people. This demographic change has
                        significant implications for both countries’ economic prospects and social
                        policies.
                        While India’s youthful population presents opportunities for economic growth,
                        China
                        faces challenges associated with an aging population and declining workforce.
                        The
                        contrasting demographic trends could reshape the balance of power in Asia in the
                        coming
                        decades, highlighting the importance of effective policymaking in harnessing
                        demographic
                        advantages.
                        In West Africa, democratic government in Niger Republic was derailed by military
                        coup
                        that led to the removal of President Mohamed Bazoum in 2023. This coup with
                        previous
                        ones in Mali and Burkina Faso obviously created tensions that posed challenges
                        to
                        democratic aspirations and regional stability, underscoring the fragility of
                        transitions
                        to authoritarian rule.

                    <p className="text-xs lg:text-sm xl:text-sm ">
                        Quite a number of significant events marked the domestic terrain in 2023 in
                        Nigeria.
                        The
                        year was a very significant one for the country as citizens went to the polls to
                        elect
                        another President that would take charge of the affairs of the country for the
                        next
                        4
                        years.
                        Penultimate to the general election was the introduction of new naira notes and
                        the
                        withdrawal of the old N200, N500 and N1000 notes respectively. However, the new
                        notes
                        were in short supply, causing significant economic disruptions which later led
                        to
                        pockets of protests in several cities of the country. The year also witnessed
                        the
                        removal of the long-debated fuel subsidy.
                        The Central Bank of Nigeria also (CBN), also announced the unification of all FX
                        windows
                        into the Investors and Exporters (I&E) window. This move aimed to streamline the
                        Nigerian FX market, but it resulted in the naira’s value fluctuating
                        significantly.
                        The country’s inflation rate rose from 18.85% at the start of the year to 19.6%
                        by
                        the
                        first quarter of 2023, and ended the year at 28.20%. Rising interest rates and a
                        stronger US dollar made it more expensive for countries to borrow, particularly
                        those
                        with high debt levels. This put additional pressure on emerging markets and
                        developing
                        economies. Nigeria’s limited access to foreign currency worsened inflation. In
                        addressing the situation, the Central Bank of Nigeria introduced policies aimed
                        at
                        reducing inflation by increasing the Monetary Policy Rate, (MPR).

                    <h1 className="font-bold text-xl">THE INSURANCE INDUSTRY</h1>
                    <p className="text-xs lg:text-sm xl:text-sm ">
                        The insurance industry on a global scale was faced with a moderate pricing
                        pressure
                        occasioned by economic and social inflation. It was a year where insurers had to
                        bring
                        to bear a high level of resilience amidst economic volatility due to rising
                        interest
                        rates and inflation. In the United States, most underwriters had the challenge
                        of
                        dealing with catastrophe and liability risks due to incessant natural disasters.
                        One key element that helped most underwriters navigate the boisterous insurance
                        marketplace was the adoption of a strategic underwriting discipline which meant
                        applying
                        sound underwriting principles in risks valuation, risk quantification and
                        corporate
                        responsibility. Alternative risk transfer solutions also gained traction across
                        both
                        preferred and non-preferred risk types.
                        Overall, the insurance landscape was characterized by economic inflation, slow
                        supply
                        chain recovery, rising labour costs, extended recovery periods while the
                        regulatory
                        environment became more intricate, focusing on insurer solvency, cyber incident
                        disclosures and the application of generative AI among other issues.
                        The Nigerian Insurance sector at the close of business in year 2023 achieved 35%
                        growth
                        over what it achieved in 2022 in terms of premium generation. From N736.2
                        billion
                        premium generated in 2022 to over N1 trillion premium in 2023. With this, the
                        long-awaited N1trillion Gross premium written set by the National Insurance
                        Commission
                        for the industry was finally achieved.
                        Furthermore, the net claims recorded by the industry was N669.4 billion with the
                        non-life component contributing N329 billion while the life arm recorded N340.4
                        billion.
                        Again, total assets of the sector during the period stood at N2.67 trillion
                        while
                        capitalization stood at N851billion in 2023.
                        The International Financial Reporting Standard IFRS 17, became operative on
                        January
                        1,
                        2023 in accordance with the deadline set by the National Insurance Commission
                        for
                        operators in the insurance industry. The methodologies, disclosure and
                        nomenclatures
                        in
                        financial reporting for the insurance industry is now expected to be carried out
                        in
                        line
                        with the new standard.
                        Furthermore, NAICOM unveiled a comprehensive 10-year strategic plan aimed at
                        transforming the insurance sector. The plan, announced at the 2023 National
                        Insurance
                        Conference, laid emphasis on seven strategic pillars, namely; regulatory
                        transformation,
                        risk-based capital models, insurance promotion and adoption, product
                        diversification,
                        distribution channel optimization, digitalization, talent development, and
                        supporting
                        Nigeria’s economic transformation.
                        There was an improvement in regulatory and technological advancement for the
                        industry in
                        2023. NAICOM’s strategic plan, (2021-2023), laid the groundwork for this
                        development.
                        The key initiatives included the implementation of project E-regulation, the
                        operationalization of the Business Process Management Solution (BPMS), and the
                        NAICOM
                        portal which enhanced the regulatory framework and digital capabilities of the
                        industry.
                        As part of its effort to deepen insurance penetration and address financial
                        inclusion in
                        the Insurance industry, NAICOM licensed eight Micro Insurers and four Takaful
                        companies.
                        The move is expected to enhance the availability of insurance products and
                        services
                        while also increasing local insurance capacity in the country.

                        In spite of the challenging macro-economic environment that characterized the year
                        under
                        review coupled with the dynamics of the new financial reporting standard, our
                        company
                        grew its insurance revenue by 23.1% from N15.7B in 2022 to N19.3B in 2023. The
                        Insurance
                        Service Expenses in line with the new accounting standard grew by 21.7% from N6B in
                        2022
                        to N7.3B in 2023. Furthermore, our Investment Income increased from N548M in 2022 to
                        N819M in 2023, representing 49.3% growth. In the area of claims administration, the
                        company paid a total of N3.3B in 2023 as against N3.2B in 2022.
                        The company’s total asset grew from N17.2B in 2022 to N22.8B in 2023, representing
                        33%
                        increase. our total equity rose by 31% from N10.4B in 2022 to N13.6B in 2023. This
                        is
                        largely due to the success recorded in our Rights Issue exercise. In addition, we
                        achieved a Profit Before Tax (PBT) of N1.42B in the year under review.
                        It was indeed a challenging year for many businesses, but the fundamentals of our

                        despite
                        the harsh economic conditions prevai l ing in the operating environment.

                    <p className="text-xs lg:text-sm xl:text-sm ">

                        Following a change in administration in 2023, Nigeria stands at a pivotal point
                        with
                        a
                        unique opportunity to return to a sustainable and inclusive growth path going by
                        the
                        fact that the government has recognized the need for a change in the course of
                        action
                        and has undertaken key reforms to restore macroeconomic stability and growth.
                        These
                        reforms coupled with the rise in global oil prices will help to reduce fiscal
                        pressures
                        and realign critical macroeconomic distortions that have hindered the country’s
                        economic
                        growth in the past.
                        Nigeria’s huge economy and growing young population offer great incentives to
                        businesses
                        in the country. The potentials in the economy are enormous and if well harnessed
                        with a
                        high level of political stability as we have witnessed in the last 25 years of
                        democratic governance, the opportunities will remain boundless. All these will
                        bring
                        about renewed interest for the insurance industry with more participation from
                        international investors.
                        We would continue to deploy resources in line with our strategic blueprint to
                        create
                        more innovative and affordable products that will continue to meet the need and
                        aspirations of our customers. Our strategic direction will be designed to
                        proactively
                        envisage the likely opportunities that are inherent in the industry and mitigate
                        against
                        possible threats that may adversely affect our operations in the coming years
                        and
                        beyond.
                        The Company will remain resilient and innovative in charting new avenues for
                        growth
                        and
                        increased profitability. We will also remain committed in delivering value to
                        all
                        our
                        stakeholders despite the numerous social, economic and environmental challenges
                        faced by
                        the communities we serve. Our continued success has been achieved through
                        financial
                        discipline and unwavering support of all our stakeholders. Our continuous effort
                        to
                        further increase our capital base is considered a veritable exercise that will
                        improve
                        our underwriting capacity and subsequently lead to improved profitability.
                        Technology continues to be a major platform for speedy distribution of products
                        and
                        services and we will consolidate our efforts in ensuring that all aspects of our

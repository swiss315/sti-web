                        We have arranged very adequate reinsurance treaties to enable us accommodate risks with high
                        sums insured and to provide us with the necessary support in the event of large claims. Our
                        treaties were arranged by a consortium of reinsurance Brokers led by United African Insurance
                        Brokers Limited, Perth Re and CICA- Re. These treaties were placed with a consortium of
                        reputable reinsurance companies locally and overseas.
